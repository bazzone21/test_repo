## Here I will describe the meaning and main differences between the `git pull` and `git` fetch commands

### **$ `git fetch` [remote repository]**
#### _Downloads the entire history from a remote repository into your local Git repo_

### **$ `git pull` [remote repository]**
#### _Downloads a history from a remote repository and merges it into the working directory_

### **Difference**
#### _The key difference between git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. The git pull command does both._
