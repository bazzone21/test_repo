## Here I will describe the meaning and main differences between the git pull and git fetch commands

### $ git fetch [remote repository]
#### Downloads the entire history from a remote repository

### $ git pull [remote repository]
#### Downloads a history from a remote repository and merges it with the local one

### Difference
#### The key difference between git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. The git pull command does both.
